<p><h3>Welcome to my home away from home away from home on the internet. I am a marketing student in the Maine Business School at the University of Maine Orono. I'm from Marshfield, Massachusetts, a nice beach town about 30 minutes south of Boston. I live with my parents Steve and June Feeney and I have two brothers Seamus and Sean. I have a dog named Indy (short for Indiana Jones), he's a rhodesian ridgeback and he's going to be 6 years old this november.</h3></p>
